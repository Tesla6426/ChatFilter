# Chat Filter by _txsla and NBT Archives

# [   ENABLE FILTER CATEGORIES ]
# Add a category here to enable it
# Permission 'chatfilter.regex.bypass' will bypass this filter
# Messages are filtered from first category in this list to last, so if two filters both match the pattern [a-zA-Z]\.(\.com|\.net), only the one listed first will be triggered
# The 'gamersafer' list is the official list of GamerSafer.com
enabled-categories:
  - 'example1'
  - 'example2'
  - 'gamersafer'


# [  SPAM LIMITER   ]
# Every time a player sends a message, it increments a counter
# Every x milliseconds that counter is decremented
# If a player hits the max messages on their counter, their messages are not shown to other players
# Permission `chatfilter.spam.bypass` will bypass this filter
spam-limiter:
  enabled: true
  count-repeats: true # should repeat messages increment twice?
  counter-ceiling: 4 # if a player's message counter goes above this number, their messages will be hidden to other players
  decrement-timer: 4000 # milliseconds between message counter decrements


# [   NOTIFY   ]
# Notify and admin when someone triggers a filter
# Players with permission 'chatfilter.notify' will be notified
# Placeholders:
# %PLAYER% - violator's username
# %MESSAGE% - message that triggered the filter
# %CATEGORY% - filter category that got triggered
# This plugin uses MiniMessage to parse messaged
