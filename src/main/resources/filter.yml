# This filter uses regex to match messages and will not work if you set up your expressions correctly
# PATTERNS ARE CASE SENSITIVE, design your regex accordingly

# Action tag allowed arguments:
# 'notify' - notify user as specified in config.yml under notify
# (only put one of the below per category)
# 'cancel' - cancel the message
# 'ghost' - return message to sender but hide message from other players
# 'ignore' - does not cancel or modify the message, but still runs the commands


# Placeholders for commands (case-sensitive)
# %PLAYER%     - offending player's username
# %UUID%       - offending player's UUID
# %MESSAGE%    - message that triggered the violation
# %PATTERN%    - pattern that matched the offending text
# %CATEGORY% - filter category that got triggered
# %WORLD%      - world that offending player was in
# %IP%         - player's IP address, useful for auto IP BANS


# You must add the category to the list in config.yml to enable
categories:
  # Name of category

    # Whether this category is enabled by default
    enabled: false
    # Action to be taken when violation occurs

      - '/ban %PLAYER%'
    # Regex patterns for the filter to match
    regex:
      - 'pattern-1'
